# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The **Automated Trading Agent** is a modular and scalable system for automating crypto trading. It integrates advanced AI/ML models, large language models (LLMs), and robust data pipelines to streamline the decision-making process in financial markets. This document explains the system architecture in detail.

## System Components
### 1. **Configuration Management**
- Handles environment-specific settings using YAML files (`default.yaml`, `development.yaml`).
- Sensitive credentials are stored in an encrypted `secrets.yaml`.

### 2. **Backend Core Logic (`src/`)**
- Central to the system with submodules for data ingestion, ML models, trading agents, and execution strategies.

#### Data Ingestion (`data_ingestion/`):
- **Purpose:** Fetches data from on-chain (e.g., Etherscan) and off-chain sources (e.g., Binance).
- **Key Modules:**
  - `blockchain_provider.py` for on-chain data.
  - `cex_api_provider.py` for centralized exchanges.
  - `social_sentiment.py` for social media scraping.

#### Models (`models/`):
- **Purpose:** ML-based analysis of market trends.
- **Key Modules:**
  - `trend_predictor.py` for price movement prediction.
  - `sentiment_analysis.py` for natural language processing.

#### LLM Agents (`llm_agents/`):
- **Purpose:** Integrate GPT-based agents for financial insights.
- **Key Modules:**
  - `analysis_agent.py` for LLM-based market sentiment.
  - `trading_agent.py` for decision-making.

#### Execution Layer (`execution/`):
- **Purpose:** Implements and executes trading strategies.
- **Key Modules:**
  - `strategy_orchestrator.py` for strategy execution.
  - `broker_api.py` for interacting with exchanges.

### 3. **Frontend Dashboard**
- Built using React and Next.js for real-time visualization.
- Displays candlestick charts, portfolio summaries, and trade alerts.

### 4. **Testing Suite**
- Includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure robustness.

### 5. **Observability**
- Monitoring and alerting system using Prometheus and Grafana.
- Advanced logging for error and performance tracking.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.
